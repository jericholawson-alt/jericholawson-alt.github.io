  Use gglgbtq to customize your plots with LGBTQ+ palettes and tailored themes. Pride aside, flag colors usually make good categorical palettes.

This post originally appeared on the [Turtletopia](https://turtletopia.github.io/2022/08/12/show-pride-on-your-plots/) blog.

If you use the [gglgbtq](https://github.com/turtletopia/gglgbtq) palettes, we'd love you to share your plots on twitter with #RainbowR.

It was always the plan for `pridepalettes` to become a package and here at RainbowR we are very grateful to our friends at Turtletopia for taking this on!

N.B. for LGBTQ+ inclusive datasets, check out [TidyRainbow](https://github.com/r-lgbtq/tidyrainbow).

This will be a short post, since I'm busy playing blues this week. At least the topic's short!

It all began with a post by RainbowR on Twitter:

{{< tweet R_LGBTQ 1555450735390871552 >}}

As a very curious person, I had to check their GitHub account. And I found a repository curiously named [pridepalettes](https://github.com/r-lgbtq/pridepalettes). I was a little disappointed to find out it's just a single script with little reusability. I hoped for a package!

A quick research showed me a few more repos with pride colors, but none I could download from CRAN. In fact, only one was a package at all!

So I took matters into my own hands and created [gglgbtq](https://github.com/turtletopia/gglgbtq).

It would be easy to just scrape the colors of multiple flags, slap a `palette_lgbtq()` function on top of 'em, and call it a day. But it would be barely usable. Have you ever used white for a group with default ggplot2 settings? It'd be barely visible.

```{r genderqueer_no_theme}
# I swear it's the last time I'd use iris dataset
library(ggplot2)
library(gglgbtq)
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = palette_lgbtq("genderqueer"))
```

This is why I included `theme_lgbtq()`. Each palette has its own custom theme for increased readability (although many themes are reused across multiple palettes). Check out the difference!

```{r genderqueer_w_theme}
# Is it considered "another time" or just "the last use part II"?
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = palette_lgbtq("genderqueer")) +
  theme_lgbtq("genderqueer")
```

The difference isn't much, but I found this gray to be the perfect balance for most palettes that include white (which is like 85% or so of all LGBT+ flags). But there are palettes without white, like this one:

```{r pansexual_w_theme}
# I spent like 10 minutes sifting through the base datasets
# but - behold! - a non-iris dataset at last
ggplot(warpbreaks, aes(x = wool, y = breaks, fill = tension)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = palette_lgbtq("pansexual")) +
  theme_lgbtq("pansexual")
```

For now I included 16 palettes, but expect more (and if you want a specific flag to be included in the next release, write an issue on GitHub, strike a message on Twitter, or send a pigeon with a letter):

![The Pride Palettes (edition gglgbtq 0.1.0)](palettes.png)

Like what you see? You can get it from CRAN or [GitHub](https://github.com/turtletopia/gglgbtq), whichever suits you best:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("gglgbtq")
remotes::install_github("turtletopia/gglgbtq")
```

Show us your pride plots on Twitter, we'd love to see them!

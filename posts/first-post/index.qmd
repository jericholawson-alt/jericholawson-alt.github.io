## Start writing blogs

This is how to start writing blogs for RainbowR. First off, since this is a R language based community you can write your blog post in `.Rmd` files or Quarto `.qmd` files. Both types of files render with no problems.

RainbowR is a Quarto based blog, so this means we need a few things from you in order for your post to succeed in getting posted. Here is a list of items to include when submitting a post:

1.  create a folder, name it
2.  create a `.Rmd` or `.qmd` file
3.  create a README markdown file, this is where you provide context to your data and post, including color (hex values) for ggplot output
4.  place all data in this folder or ensure that the `url` you provide is working and is stated in your README file
5.  include images related to post, but not the ggplot output ones, those will be rendered with RainbowR theme.

## Check your output

Having a dark purple background blog comes with some colors better suited for ggplot output, to help define what color palettes or hex values to provide in your README file, the `blog purple background color` is `#1A0933`. To quickly see what ggplot output looks like, see the [post with code]() post.

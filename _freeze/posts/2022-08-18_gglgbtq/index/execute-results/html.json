Pride aside, flag colors usually make good categorical palettes.\ncategories: [\"R\", \"turtletools\", \"ggplot2\", \"pride\", \"LGBTQ+\", \"palettes\"]\nimage: palettes.png\ntwitter-card:\n  image: palettes.png\n  card-style: \"summary_large_image\"\n  creator: \"@Rturtletopia\"\n  site: \"@Rturtletopia\"\n---\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nThis post originally appeared on the [Turtletopia](https://turtletopia.github.io/2022/08/12/show-pride-on-your-plots/) blog.\n\nIf you use the [gglgbtq](https://github.com/turtletopia/gglgbtq) palettes, we'd love you to share your plots on twitter with #RainbowR.\n\nIt was always the plan for `pridepalettes` to become a package and here at RainbowR we are very grateful to our friends at Turtletopia for taking this on!\n\nN.B. for LGBTQ+ inclusive datasets, check out [TidyRainbow](https://github.com/r-lgbtq/tidyrainbow).\n:::\n\n\nThis will be a short post, since I'm busy playing blues this week. At least the topic's short!\n\nIt all began with a post by RainbowR on Twitter:\n\n\n{{< tweet R_LGBTQ 1555450735390871552 >}}\n\n\n\nAs a very curious person, I had to check their GitHub account. And I found a repository curiously named [pridepalettes](https://github.com/r-lgbtq/pridepalettes). I was a little disappointed to find out it's just a single script with little reusability. I hoped for a package!\n\nA quick research showed me a few more repos with pride colors, but none I could download from CRAN. In fact, only one was a package at all!\n\nSo I took matters into my own hands and created [gglgbtq](https://github.com/turtletopia/gglgbtq).\n\nIt would be easy to just scrape the colors of multiple flags, slap a `palette_lgbtq()` function on top of 'em, and call it a day. But it would be barely usable. Have you ever used white for a group with default ggplot2 settings? It'd be barely visible.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# I swear it's the last time I'd use iris dataset\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(gglgbtq)\nggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, color = Species)) +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = palette_lgbtq(\"genderqueer\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/genderqueer_no_theme-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is why I included `theme_lgbtq()`. Each palette has its own custom theme for increased readability (although many themes are reused across multiple palettes). Check out the difference!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Is it considered \"another time\" or just \"the last use part II\"?\nggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, color = Species)) +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = palette_lgbtq(\"genderqueer\")) +\n  theme_lgbtq(\"genderqueer\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/genderqueer_w_theme-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe difference isn't much, but I found this gray to be the perfect balance for most palettes that include white (which is like 85% or so of all LGBT+ flags). But there are palettes without white, like this one:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# I spent like 10 minutes sifting through the base datasets\n# but - behold! - a non-iris dataset at last\nggplot(warpbreaks, aes(x = wool, y = breaks, fill = tension)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = palette_lgbtq(\"pansexual\")) +\n  theme_lgbtq(\"pansexual\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/pansexual_w_theme-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor now I included 16 palettes, but expect more (and if you want a specific flag to be included in the next release, write an issue on GitHub, strike a message on Twitter, or send a pigeon with a letter):\n\n![The Pride Palettes (edition gglgbtq 0.1.0)](palettes.png)\n\nLike what you see? You can get it from CRAN or [GitHub](https://github.com/turtletopia/gglgbtq), whichever suits you best:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"gglgbtq\")\nremotes::install_github(\"turtletopia/gglgbtq\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nShow us your pride plots on Twitter, we'd love to see them!\n",

[posit::conf(2024)](https://posit.co/conference/) is taking place in Seattle, August 12-13, 2024.

## Talk

We're in the conference programme, in the [Lightning Talks](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf24/publiccatalog/page/publiccatalog/session/1712003933811001s83h) session, on Tuesday, August 13, 1:00pm -- 2:20pm PDT, in room Columbia A/B. We're the final talk in session: "rainbowR - a community that supports, connects and promotes LGBTQ+ people who code in R".

The talk is being presented as a pre-recorded video, since unfortunately Ella can't be at the conference in-person. The video will be available after the conference.

## People

From the rainbowR team, Daniel Sjoberg will be representing the community in-person at the conference, so look out for him.

## Wednesday lunch

Daniel will put a rainbowR poster, and stickers, on a couple of lunch tables in the Regency Ballroom on Wednesday, so come and hang out with the community then and there. Everyone welcome, LGBTQ+ folk and allies alike!

## Discord

If you're registered to attend posit::conf(2024), either in-person or virtually, you should have access to the [posit::conf(2024) Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/1223312405552173208). Within that, there's a [#rainbowr](https://discord.com/channels/1223312405552173208/1268265719020392621) channel, so head there to connect with the community during the conference.

## Slack

To keep up-to-date with what's happening at the conference, there's also a #posit-conf-2024-seattle channel in the rainbowR Slack, so if you'll be at the conference, be sure to add yourself there.^[If you can't see it, go to '+ Add Channels' under your channel list, then 'Browse channels'.] 

If you're not already in the rainbowR Slack, please fill out the [Join](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1y7SOWE3IW-fpR_5Cd4mK-CMUpFZ-hvhY4cTj34JqTVE/) form and you'll be sent an invitation.

We reply to everyone who fills in the join form with a personalised welcome e-mail, but there may not be time for us to that during posit::conf(2024). We'll send out Slack invitations quickly, but it may take us a week or two to send out the e-mails.

## Posters and stickers

Here's the poster to look for:^[Because this was designed for print, the colours are slightly different to those that we use on the website and for other online images.]

We have stickers too!

Daniel has them, and there should be some left around the conference space.

If you'd like a sticker and won't be in Seattle, ping Ella a (direct) message in the Slack group, or via [hello@rainbowr.org](mailto:hello@rainbowr.org) with your address and she'll send you some.
